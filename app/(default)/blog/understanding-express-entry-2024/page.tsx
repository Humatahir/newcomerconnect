                  Canada's Express Entry system remains the primary pathway for skilled workers seeking permanent residence. In 2024, the system has seen significant updates, particularly with the introduction of category-based selection draws. This guide will walk you through how Express Entry works, what's new, and how Newcomer Connect can help you navigate this complex process.
                </p>

                <h3 className="h3 mt-12">What is Express Entry?</h3>
                <p>
                  Express Entry is not an immigration program itself, but a system used by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to manage applications for three key economic immigration programs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP):</strong> For skilled workers with foreign work experience.</li>
                  <li><strong>Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP):</strong> For skilled workers qualified in a skilled trade.</li>
                  <li><strong>Canadian Experience Class (CEC):</strong> For skilled workers who have Canadian work experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Candidates who are eligible for one of these programs can submit a profile to the Express Entry pool. They are then ranked using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).
                </p>

                <h3 className="h3 mt-12">The Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)</h3>
                <p>
                  The CRS is a points-based system that ranks candidates in the Express Entry pool. Points are awarded based on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Core/Human Capital Factors:</strong> Age, education, language proficiency (English and/or French), and Canadian work experience.</li>
                  <li><strong>Spouse or Common-law Partner Factors:</strong> Your partner's education, language proficiency, and Canadian work experience.</li>
                  <li><strong>Skill Transferability Factors:</strong> A combination of your education, foreign work experience, and language skills.</li>
                  <li><strong>Additional Points:</strong> Awarded for a provincial nomination, a valid job offer, Canadian study experience, a sibling in Canada, or strong French language skills.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  IRCC holds regular draws from the pool, inviting the highest-ranking candidates to apply for permanent residence.
                </p>

                <h3 className="h3 mt-12">New in 2024: Category-Based Selection Draws</h3>
                <p>
                  The most significant change in recent times is the introduction of category-based selection draws. These draws target candidates with specific skills, work experience, or language abilities that align with Canada's economic priorities and labour market needs. For 2024, the targeted categories include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>French-language proficiency</li>
                  <li>Healthcare occupations</li>
                  <li>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) occupations</li>
                  <li>Trade occupations (e.g., carpenters, plumbers, contractors)</li>
                  <li>Transport occupations</li>
                  <li>Agriculture and agri-food occupations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This means that even if your CRS score isn't at the top of the general pool, you may still receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) if your profile matches one of these in-demand categories.
                </p>
